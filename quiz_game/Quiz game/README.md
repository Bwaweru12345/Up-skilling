# Running the code description
This is a brief explanation of how to run the code for the [Simple-quiz-game](https://github.com/Bwaweru12345/Simple-quiz-game) that I have writen.

# Running the application
- Running the code is very straight forward.
- Through this [Readme] file i will take you step by step in running the code.

# Start
- Copy the SSH key and head on to the computer's terminal and git clone the github files so as to run and store them on your local machine.
- In order to git clone the files onto your local machine type 'git clone' then paste the SSH key then press enter.
- Once you have git cloned you will be given the name of the file through the terminal and you will copy it.
- Once you have copied it on one line of the terminal you shall type the command 'cd' then paste the name given through the terminal.
- Once you run the above command, type in 'code .' so as to load those files in the Visual Studio Application.
- Once the files have been loaded, run the code through the VSCOs built in terminal
